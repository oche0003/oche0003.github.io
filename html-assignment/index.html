    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Here is a brief synopsis of who I am. My name is perpetual but I go by Perpy. I am 18 years old. My birthday is June 25<sup>th</sup> 2004. I was born and raised in Nigeria then immigrated to Canada in 2016. Coming from a big family, I have 1 brother and 3 sisters making me the <em>middle child</em> . </p>
    <p>Drawing, cooking, hairstyling, and video editing are skills I have acquired throughout my life. I consider myself to be a multifaceted person hence why the <abbr>IMD</abbr>  program was the best option for me. I plan to use all the information I learn from this program to start multiple successful businesses in the entertainment industry.
